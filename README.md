# Python FPS and System Monitor

This is a Python script that uses the Pygame library to display the current FPS (frames per second) and system information such as GPU usage and CPU usage in a resizable window.
<br>
<h1>Dependencies</h1>

   * Pygame
   * Psutil
   * Gpustat

<h1>Installation</h1>

 1. Install the dependencies by running `pip install pygame psutil gpustat` in the command line. <br>
 2. Download and clone the script by `git clone https://github.com/HoodedUnicorn/Python-FPS-Monitor.git` <br>
 3. Run the script using `python FPS-Monitor.py`

<h1>Usage</h1>

The script will display the current FPS in the top left corner of the window. The GPU and CPU usage will be displayed on the right side of the window.

You can resize the window to your desired size by clicking and dragging the edges of the window.

To exit the script, simply close the window or press the 'X' button in the top right corner of the window.
Additional Features

You can customize the script to display additional information such as GPU memory usage or CPU temperature. You can also change the font, text color and background color of the window to match your personal preferences.
Limitations
